<h3>A User-Centered Design Approach</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The web design and development process shares several resemblances to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process">software development process</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle">systems development life cycle</a> and is influenced by the rich history and practice of related fields such as systems engineering and information science. Building upon several influential methodologies and preceding models, the following is a simple 5-Step process specifically for web design and development that embraces <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design">User-centered design (UCD)</a> and consists of 5 D’s: <em>Define, Draft, Design, Develop, and Deliver.</em></p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>User-centered design (UCD)</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>user-driven development (UDD)</strong>&nbsp;is a framework of processes (not restricted to interfaces or technologies) in which usability goals, user characteristics, environment, tasks and workflow of a product, service or process are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process. User-centered design can be characterized as a multi-stage problem-solving process that not only requires designers to analyze and envision the way users are likely to consume a product, but also to validate their assumptions with regard to the user behavior in real world tests. These tests are conducted with/without actual users during each stage of the process from requirements, pre-production models and post production, completing a circle of proof back to and ensuring that “development proceeds with the user as the center of focus.

<h3>A Simplified 5-Phase Process:</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Define</strong>&nbsp;– Define the project, problem(s), and stakeholder’s primary goals via the project brief. Gather background info to define user profiles, goals, and tasks.</li><li><strong>Draft</strong>&nbsp;– Brainstorm conceptual solutions; draft the information architecture, site-maps, wireframes, prototypes, content hierarchy, and structure.</li><li><strong>Design</strong>&nbsp;– Visualize and communicate the user interface design via mood boards, type studies, color studies, prototypes, iterative mockups, and multiple rounds of refinements.</li><li><strong>Develop</strong>&nbsp;– Build the interactive, fully functioning product using web standard compliant, accessible, valid, semantic markup, styling, and scripting.</li><li><strong>Deliver</strong>&nbsp;– Via due diligence, fix all bugs and conduct multiple tests for quality assurance across multiple platforms, browsers, devices, and screen-sizes.</li></ol>

<h2>A Brief Backstory</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Preceding Influential Models</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the most notable approaches that predate web development is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall model</a>: a linear, step-by-step sequential process that is inherently flawed due to the fact that, like a waterfall, it only flows in one direction. Broken down into five phases, a typical waterfall process entails defining system requirements, designing, implementing/coding, testing, and maintaining.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the text Usability for the Web (2002), Brinck, Gergle, and Wood illustrated a “Pervasive Usability Process” drafted specifically for web design and development. It consists of five phases that are sequential yet iterative through the process of continual evaluation. The five stages are requirements analysis, conceptual design, mockups and prototypes, production, and launch, and most closely resembles the Five D’s approach above.</p>

<p>In contrast to the waterfall model, other notable approaches are&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_design">iterative design</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development">incremental development</a>, cyclical design and development processes that entail multiple rounds of designing, prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining.</p>

<p><em>An iterative process</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In recent years, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile software development process</a>&nbsp;has had a big impact on web design and development. It embraces adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement. Designed for speed, it encourages rapid and flexible responses to change throughout the process.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all web design and development process. However, there are several existing models to follow as frameworks that embrace different principles related to user-centered design.</p>
