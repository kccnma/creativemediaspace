<h2>What is <strong>Creative Media</strong>?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Depending upon who you ask, <strong>Creative Media</strong> can have several different definitions. Some academic institutions are beginning to use it as an umbrella term to include different-but-related creative media sub-disciplines, such as digital art, digital media, new media art, graphic design, interaction design, user experience design, etc. We define it as <em>an emerging interdisciplinary study of the convergence of art, design, and technology.</em></p>
