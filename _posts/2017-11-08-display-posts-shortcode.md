Display Posts Shortcode is a Wordpress plugin written to allow users to easily display listings of posts without knowing PHP or editing template files. Add the shortcode in a post or page, and use the arguments to query based on tag, category, post type, and many other possibilities. You can also customize the output with available parameters.

<pre>[display-posts category="web" image_size="thumbnail"]</pre>
